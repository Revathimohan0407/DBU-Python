# Bonus Take-home exercise
# Use the Flask Celery demo code above to create a web application that allows users to upload a CSV file, 
# start a background task to process the file, and check the status of the task. 
# The background task should read the CSV file, perform some processing (e.g., calculate the sum of a column), 
# and return the result to the user. 
# The user should be able to check the status of the task and download the result once the task is complete.
