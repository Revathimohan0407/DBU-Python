# Machine Learning with Python and Scikit-Learn (SKLearn)

# Key Terms and Definitions:

# 1. Dataset:
#    A collection of data points or instances, usually organized in rows (instances) and columns (features).
#    In ML, datasets are typically split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

# 2. Feature:
#    An individual measurable property or characteristic of the data. In sklearn, features are represented by columns in a dataset.
#    Example: Age, Income, Gender.

# 3. Target (Label):
#    The output variable or the value that the model is trying to predict. In supervised learning, the target is known during training.

# 4. Model:
#    A mathematical representation created by the ML algorithm to map input features to the target variable.
#    Scikit-learn provides various models such as DecisionTree, RandomForest, LinearRegression, etc.

# 5. Training:
#    The process of feeding the model with data so that it can learn the relationships between features and the target.

# 6. Testing:
#    After training, the model is evaluated on unseen data (test set) to assess how well it generalizes to new data.

# 7. Supervised Learning:
#    A type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data (features with corresponding targets). 
#    Algorithms include classification and regression models.

# 8. Unsupervised Learning:
#    A type of ML where the model is trained on data without labeled targets. The goal is to find patterns in the data.
#    Algorithms include clustering and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).

# 9. Classification:
#    A type of supervised learning where the target variable is categorical (e.g., spam or not spam).

# 10. Regression:
#    A type of supervised learning where the target variable is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices).

# 11. Overfitting:
#    When a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and details that don't generalize to unseen data.
#    Overfitted models perform poorly on test data.

# 12. Underfitting:
#    When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and test data.

# 13. Cross-Validation:
#    A technique for assessing how well a model generalizes by dividing the data into multiple subsets (folds) and training/testing the model multiple times.

# 14. Hyperparameters:
#    Parameters that are set before the learning process begins (e.g., learning rate, max depth in decision trees).
#    They are not learned by the model but tuned to optimize performance.

# 15. Confusion Matrix:
#    A table used in classification problems to evaluate the performance of a model, showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

# Basic Flow of ML with Scikit-learn:

# 1. Import the necessary libraries.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# 2. Load the dataset (this could be from CSV, database, etc.).
# For example, let's create a dummy dataset.
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature1': np.random.rand(100),
    'feature2': np.random.rand(100),
    'target': np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)
})

# 3. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]  # Features
y = data['target']  # Target

# 4. Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 5. Choose a model. Here, we'll use Logistic Regression (a simple classification model).
model = LogisticRegression()

# 6. Train the model on the training data.
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 7. Make predictions on the test data.
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# 8. Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# 9. Print the evaluation metrics.
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Confusion Matrix:\n {conf_matrix}')

# Summary:
# 1. We imported the necessary libraries.
# 2. Loaded and prepared a dataset by splitting it into features (X) and target (y).
# 3. We trained a Logistic Regression model on the training set.
# 4. Made predictions on the test set.
# 5. Evaluated the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

# This general flow can be applied to most ML models in scikit-learn by swapping out the model (LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, etc.).
